## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
- Important characteristics of good design:
  ```text
  - Discoverability: Able to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them
  
  - Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
  ```
### The complexity of Modern Devices (p.23)
- Design
  ```text
  - Industrial design(form and material): The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer.

  - Interaction design(understandability and usability): The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance peopleâ€™s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.

  - Experience design(emotional impact): The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.
  ```

- The reasons for the deficiencies in human-machine interaction
  ```text
  1. Limitations of today's technology
  2. Self-imposed restrictions by the designers
  3. A complete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary for effective HCI.
  ```

- Must design machines on the assumption that people will make errors

### Human-Centered Design(HCD) (p. 27)
```text
- An approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.

- An design philosophy. Starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet.
```

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction (p. 29)
Discoverability results from appropriate application of five fundamental psychological concepts:
```text
affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback
```
#### AFFORDANCES
```text
The relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). 

An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.

If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call this property a signifier.
```
#### SIGNIFIERS
```text
The signaling component of affordances signifiers.

Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
```

##### Difference between affordances and signifiers
```text
- Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.
- Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.
- Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function.
```

#### MAPPING
```text
The relationship between the elements of two sets of things.
```

#### FEEDBACK
```text
Communicating the results of an action.

- Immediate
- Informative
- Planned
```

##### CONCEPTUAL MODELS
```text
An explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works.
```

### System Image
```text
Is what can be perceived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation, instructions, signifiers, and any information available from websites and help lines).
```

### The Paradox of Technology
```text
The same technology that simplifies life by providing more
functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use.
```

### The Design Challenge
```text
The challenge is to use the principles of human-centered design to produce positive results, products that enhance lives and add to our pleasure and enjoyment.
