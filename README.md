## :cloud: Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
- Important characteristics of good design:
  ```text
  - Discoverability: Able to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them
  
  - Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
  ```
### The complexity of Modern Devices (p.23)
- Design
  ```text
  - Industrial design(form and material): The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer.

  - Interaction design(understandability and usability): The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.

  - Experience design(emotional impact): The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.
  ```

- The reasons for the deficiencies in human-machine interaction
  ```text
  1. Limitations of today's technology
  2. Self-imposed restrictions by the designers
  3. A complete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary for effective HCI.
  ```

- Must design machines on the assumption that people will make errors

### Human-Centered Design(HCD) (p. 27)
```text
- An approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.

- An design philosophy. Starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet.
```

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction (p. 29)
Discoverability results from appropriate application of five fundamental psychological concepts:
```text
affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback
```
#### AFFORDANCES
```text
The relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). 

An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.

If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call this property a signifier.
```
#### SIGNIFIERS
```text
The signaling component of affordances signifiers.

Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
```

##### Difference between affordances and signifiers
```text
- Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.
- Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.
- Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function.
```

#### MAPPING
```text
The relationship between the elements of two sets of things.
```

#### FEEDBACK
```text
Communicating the results of an action.

- Immediate
- Informative
- Planned
```

##### CONCEPTUAL MODELS
```text
An explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works.
```

### System Image
```text
Is what can be perceived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation, instructions, signifiers, and any information available from websites and help lines).
```

### The Paradox of Technology
```text
The same technology that simplifies life by providing more
functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use.
```

### The Design Challenge
```text
The challenge is to use the principles of human-centered design to produce positive results, products that enhance lives and add to our pleasure and enjoyment.
```

## :sunny: Chapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions
### How People Do Things: The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
```text
- The Gulf of Execution: where they try to figure out how it operates
- The Gulf of Evaluation: where they try to figure out what happened
```

### The Seven Stages of Action (p.59)
- 2 parts of an action:
    ```text
    - Executing the action (doing)
    - Evaluating the results (interpreting)
    ```
- 7 Stages (action cycle, p.60):
    ```text
    1. Goal (form the goal)
    2. Plan (the action)
    3. Specify (an action sequence)
    4. Perform (the action sequence)
    5. Perceive (the state of the world)
    6. Interpret (the perception)
    7. Compare (the outcome with the goal)
    ```

### Human Thought: Mostly Subconscious (p. 66)
```text
Subconscious              |      Conscious
===================================================================
Fast                      |      Slow
Automatic                 |      Controlled
Multiple resources        |      Limited resources
Controls skilled behavior |      Invoked for novel situations: when
                          |      learning, when in danger, 
                          |      when things go wrong
```


### Human Cognition and Emotion (p. 68)
- 3 Levels of Processing
```text
1. Visceral: the lizard brain. These are part of the basic protective mechanisms of the human affective system, making quick judgments about the environment.

2. Behavioral: the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns.

3. Reflective: the home of conscious cognition. This is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place.
```
- Design must take place at all levels

- High-level reflective cognition can trigger lower-level emotions. 

- Lower-level emotions can trigger higher-level reflective cognition.

### The Seven Stages of Action and the Three Levels of Processing (p.74)
```text
1. Visceral response is at the lowest level: the control of simple muscles and sensing the state of the world and body. 

2. The behavioral level is about expectations, so it is sensitive to the expectations of the action sequence
and then the interpretations of the feedback. 

3. The reflective level is a part of the goal- and plan-setting activity as well as affected by the comparison
of expectations with what has actually happened.
```

### People as Storytellers
```text
Everyone forms stories (conceptual models) to explain what they have observed.
```

### Blaming the Wrong Things (p.78)
#### LEARNED HELPLESSNESS
```text
It refers to the situation in which people experience repeated failure at a task. 
As a result, they decide that the task cannot be done, at least not by them: they are helpless. 
They stop trying.
```

#### POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
```text
Think positively, for yourself and for the people you interact with.
```

### Falsely Blaming Yourself (p. 84)
```
```

### The Seven Stages of Action: Seven Fundamental Design Principles (p.90)
```text
1. Discoverability. It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device.

2. Feedback. There is full and continuous information about the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. 
After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.

3. Conceptual model. The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. 
The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results.

4. Affordances. The proper affordances exist to make the desired actions possible.

5. Signifiers. Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible.

6. Mappings. The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity.

7. Constraints. Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretation.
```

## :snowflake: Chapter 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World
### Precise Behavior from Imprecise Knowledge (p.94)
4 reasons:
```text
1. Knowledge is both in the head and in the world.
2. Great precision is not required.
3. Natural constraints exist in the world.
4. Knowledge of cultural constraints and conventions exists in the head.
```

#### KNOWLEDGE IS IN THE WORLD
```text
Whenever knowledge needed to do a task is readily available in the world, the need for us to learn it diminishes.
```

People function through their use of two kinds of knowledge:
```text
- Knowledge of: includes the knowledge of facts and rules. “Stop at red traffic lights.”

- Knowledge how: what psychologists call procedural knowledge. 
The knowledge that enables a person to be a skilled musician, to return a serve in tennis, or to move the tongue properly when saying the phrase “frightening witches.”
```

#### WHEN PRECISION IS UNEXPECTEDLY REQUIRED
```text
Normally, people do not need precision in their judgments. 
All that is needed is the combination of knowledge in the world and in the head that makes decisions unambiguous. 
Everything works just fine unless the environment changes so that the combined knowledge is no longer sufficient: this can lead to havoc.
```

#### CONSTRAINTS SIMPLIFY MEMORY
```text
External constraints exert control over the permissible choice of words, thus dramatically reducing the memory load.
```

### Memory Is Knowledge in the Head
### The Structure of Memory (p.110)
#### SHORT-TERM OR WORKING MEMORY
```text
Retains the most recent experiences or material that is currently being thought about. 
It is the memory of the just present. Information is retained automatically and retrieved without effort; 
but the amount of information that can be retained this way is severely limited.
```
#### LONG-TERM MEMORY
```text
Memory for the past. As a rule, it takes time for information to get into LTM and time and effort to get it out again.

Knowledge in the head is actually knowledge in memory: internal knowledge
```
Two ways to retrieve knowledge:
```text
1. Memory for arbitrary things. The items to be retained seem arbitrary, with no meaning and no particular relationship to one another or to things already known.

2. Memory for meaningful things. The items to be retained form meaningful relationships with themselves or with other things already known.
```

### Approximate Models: Memory in the Real World (p.119)
#### SCIENTIFIC THEORY VERSUS EVERYDAY PRACTICE


### Knowledge in the Head(p.125)
#### REMINDING: PROSPECTIVE MEMORY
```text
the first phrase simply denotes the task of remembering to do some activity at a future time. 
The second phrase denotes planning abilities, the ability to imagine future scenarios.
```

2 aspects to a reminder:
```text
- the signal: knowing that something is to be remembered.
- the message: remembering the information itself.
```

### The Tradeoff Between Knowledge in the World and in the Head (p.128)
```text
Gaining the advantages of knowledge in the world means losing the advantages of knowledge in the head.

Detailed info see p.129 table
```

### Memory in Multiple Heads, Multiple Devices (p.130)

### Natural Mapping
3 levels of mapping:
```text
- Best mapping: Controls are mounted directly on the item to be controlled.

- Second-best mapping: Controls are as close as possible to the object to be controlled.

- Third-best mapping: Controls are arranged in the same spatial configuration as the objects to be controlled.
```

### Culture and Design: Natural Mappings Can Vary with Culture (p.137)


## :zap: Chapter 4: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback
### Four Kinds of Constraints: Physical, Cultural, Semantic, and Logical (p.144)
4 kinds of constraints:
```text
- Physical: rely upon properties of the physical world for their operation; no special training is necessary.

- Cultural: Each culture has a set of allowable actions for social situations.

- Semantic: rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of possible actions.

- Logical: there is a logical relationship between the spatial or functional layout of components and the things that they affect or are affected by.
```

### Applying Affordances, Signifiers, and Constraints to Everyday Objects (p.151)
#### ACTIVITY-CENTERED CONTROLS

### Constraints That Force the Desired Behavior (p.160)
#### FORCING FUNCTIONS
```text
A form of physical constraint: situations in which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening.
```

#### INTERLOCKS
```text
Forces operations to take place in proper sequence.
```

#### LOCK-INS
```text
A lock-in keeps an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it.
```

#### LOCKOUTS
```text
A lockout prevents someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an event from occurring.
```

### Conventions, Constraints, and Affordances (p.164)
#### CONVENTIONS ARE CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS
#### WHEN CONVENTIONS CHANGE: THE CASE OF DESTINATION-CONTROL ELEVATORS
#### PEOPLE’S RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN CONVENTIONS

### The Faucet: A Case History of Design (p.169)
### Using Sound as Signifiers (p.174)
#### WHEN SILENCE KILLS
```text
- Alerting
- Orientation
- Lack of annoyance
- Standardization versus individualization
```

## :ocean: Chapter 5: Human Error? No, Bad Design
### Understanding Why There Is Error (p.182)
#### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
```text
Investigate the accident until the single, underlying cause is found.
```
#### THE FIVE WHYS

### Deliberate Violations (p.188)
### Two Types of Errors: Slips and Mistakes (p.189)
#### DEFINITIONS: ERRORS, SLIPS, AND MISTAKES
Errors have two major forms.
```text
- Slips occur when the goal is correct, but the required actions are not done properly: the execution is flawed. 

- Mistakes occur when the goal or plan is wrong.

- Slips and mistakes can be further divided based upon their underlying causes. 

- Memory lapses can lead to either slips or mistakes, depending upon whether the memory failure was at the highest level of cognition (mistakes) or at lower (subconscious) levels (slips).

- Although deliberate violations of procedures are clearly inappropriate behaviors that often lead to accidents, these are not considered as errors.
```

##### SLIPS
2 major classes of slips:
```text
- action-based
- memory-lapse
```
##### MISTAKES
3 major classes:
```text
- rule-based
- knowledge-based
- memory-lapse
```

##### ERROR AND THE SEVEN STAGES OF ACTION (p.191)

### The Classification of Slips (p.192)
#### CAPTURE SLIPS
```text
Defined as the situation where, instead of the desired activity, a more frequently or recently performed one gets done instead: it captures the activity.

Capture errors are partial memory-lapse errors.
```
#### DESCRIPTION-SIMILARITY SLIPS
```text
The error is to act upon an item similar to the target. This happens when the description of the target is sufficiently vague.
```
#### MEMORY-LAPSE SLIPS
```text
The immediate cause of most memory-lapse failures is interruptions, events that intervene between the time an action is decided upon and the time it is completed.

ways to combat memory-lapse errors:
- minimize the number of steps
- provide vivid reminders of steps that need to be completed
```

#### MODE-ERROR SLIPS
```text
A mode error occurs when a device has different states in which the same controls have different meanings: we call these states modes.

Mode errors are inevitable in anything that has more possible
actions than it has controls or displays; that is, the controls mean different things in the different modes.
```

### The Classification of Mistakes (p.198)
#### RULE-BASED MISTAKES
```text
- The situation is mistakenly interpreted
- The correct rule is invoked, but the rule itself is faulty
- The correct rule is invoked, but the outcome is incorrectly evaluated.
```
#### KNOWLEDGE-BASED MISTAKES
```text
Knowledge-based behavior takes place when the situation is novel enough that there are no skills or rules to cover it.
```

#### MEMORY-LAPSE MISTAKES
```text
Memory lapses can lead to mistakes if the memory failure leads to forgetting the goal or plan of action. 
A common cause of the lapse is an interruption that leads to forgetting the evaluation of the current state of the environment.
```

### Social and Institutional Pressures (p.205)
#### CHECKLISTS
```text
Checklists are powerful tools, proven to increase the accuracy of behavior and to reduce error, particularly slips and memory lapses.
```

### Reporting Error (p.210)
#### CASE STUDY: JIDOKA—HOW TOYOTA HANDLES ERROR
#### POKA-YOKE: ERROR PROOFING
#### NASA’S AVIATION SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM

### Detecting Error (p.213)
```text
Errors do not necessarily lead to harm if they are discovered quickly.
```
#### EXPLAINING AWAY MISTAKES
##### IN HINDSIGHT, EVENTS SEEM LOGICAL

### Designing for Error (p.217)
```text
- Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes.

- Do sensibility checks.

- Make it possible to reverse actions—to “undo” them—or make it harder to do what cannot be reversed.

- Make it easier for people to discover the errors that do occur, and make them easier to correct.

- Don’t treat the action as an error; rather, try to help the person complete the action properly. Think of the action as an approximation to what is desired.
```

#### DESIGN LESSONS FROM THE STUDY OF ERRORS
##### ADDING CONSTRAINTS TO BLOCK ERRORS
##### UNDO
##### CONFIRMATION AND ERROR MESSAGES
```text
- Make the item being acted upon more prominent.
- Make the operation reversible.
```
